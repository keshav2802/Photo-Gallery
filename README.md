# Personal Photo Gallery

A personal photo gallery app which lets me store my favourite images online.

# Description

This is a photo gallery app which allows me to upload photos and store them permanently online. It has a very cool and simple UI. It is powered by firebase at the backend. It has cool animation effects. When an image is uploaded the images arrange themselves automatically in a grid. It also shows a progress bar while the image gets uploaded. Also when an image is clicked, it shows the larger version of the image in a modal popup. The app does not need a refresh to show an image which is just uploaded.

# Tech used:

* React.js
* Framer Motion(React library for animations)
* Firebase
